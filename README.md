# ðŸ“ˆ CryptoTracker â€“ iOS App

An iOS application that fetches **real-time cryptocurrency market data** using the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).  
This project demonstrates my **networking skills in iOS** (API integration, JSON parsing, async handling) and also showcases **backend handling skills** such as data caching, error handling, and clean architecture.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fetch live data from the **CoinGecko API**.  
- Display **top cryptocurrencies** with price, market cap, and daily changes.  
- Detailed screen with coin info, 24h price chart, and percentage change.  
- Implements **async/await** for networking.

## ðŸ›  Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Networking in iOS**:
  - `URLSession` with async/await.  
  - Codable models for parsing JSON.  
  - API request building and response validation.  

- **Backend Handling**:
  - Graceful error handling (network errors, decoding failures).  
  - Data persistence with `UserDefaults` / `CoreData` (for caching).  
  - Retry logic and offline support.  

- **Architecture**:
  - **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for better testability.  
  - Dependency Injection for networking services.  
  - Scalable project structure.
